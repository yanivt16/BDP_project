# Final project for Big Data Platforms - Israel Police Data Analysis

## Overview
In this work, we analyze the database given by the Israeli Police by using PySpark.
This work includes the following files:
 * `PolicieDataAnalysis.ipynb` - Python notebook with the code we used for the entire work (runs best in Google Colab).
 * `Israel Police Data Analysis.pdf` - Final paper that documents our work and conclusion.
 * `Israel Police Data Analysis Overleaf.zip` - Final paper LATEX zip.
 * `Israeli Police data Project presentation.pptx` - Project presentation that was shown in class.
 * `-3-2022-.csv` - The Israeli Police database updated to the 3rd quarter of 2022.
 * `en_df.csv` - The database translated to English. The file is too heavy for GitHub so we uploaded it to Google Drive.
 * `city_data.csv`, `s_e_2019.csv` - Additional Israeli cities database provided by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics that shows the population number and socioeconomic cluster of every city.

###Non of the databases above need to be downloaded locally, the code calls them from a shared and open folder.
